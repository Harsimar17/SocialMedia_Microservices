# 📱 Social Media Application Microservices(say Instagram)

This repository documents the architecture and purpose of each microservice that powers the **Social Media App**, a distributed, scalable application built using **Spring Boot Microservices**.

---

## 🧩 What Is This Application?

The Social Media App is a microservice-based backend platform that mimics the functionality of a modern social network (like Instagram or Facebook). It enables users to register, log in, create posts, like posts, and comment — all through modular, independently deployed services.

## 🚀 Key Features
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- JWT based routing using Spring Cloud Gateway
- Modular, loosely coupled microservices
- MySQL-based persistent storage
- REST communication between services
- Service discovery using Eureka
- Can be scaled independently

## 🧱 Microservice Overview

| **Microservice**              | **Role / Responsibilities**                                  | **Base URL**                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UserService**               | User creation, login, profile retrieval and management       | `http://localhost:7070/user-service`                          |
| **PostService**               | Manage posts and categories                                  | `http://localhost:7070/post-service`                          |
| **ReactionService**           | Handles likes and comments on posts                          | `http://localhost:7070/reaction-service`                      |
| **GatewayService**            | Central entry point, handles routing and JWT authentication  | `http://localhost:7070`                                       |
| **SocialMediaAppRegistry**    | Service discovery; monitors registration and availability    | `http://localhost:8761`(UI to see status of services)         |
| **ServiceClient**             | Responsible for inter-commmunication of microservices        |                                                               |

> ⚠️ All internal services (except login and sign up endpoints) are protected via JWT and routed through the API Gateway.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add Swagger for all services
- Frontend (Angular) to consume these services
- Dockerize all services and use Docker Compose
- Integrate centralized logging (ELK or Loki stack)
- Implement rate-limiting, circuit breakers (Resilience4j)
- Deploy to cloud (AWS) or Kubernetes
- Introduce caching mechanism say redis or ehcache in get request
